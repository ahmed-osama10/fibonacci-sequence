# Fibonacci Sequence Expression Tree

This program implements an expression tree that evaluates mathematical expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, and Fibonacci operations.

## Development Environment

The program is written in C and can be compiled and executed on any platform that supports a C compiler. Here are the development environment details used for this project:

- Operating System: [Specify the OS used, e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04]
- Compiler: [Specify the compiler used, e.g., GCC, Clang]
- Development IDE/Text Editor: [Specify the IDE or text editor used, e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks]

## How to Compile

To compile the source code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

2. Download the source code files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ahmed-osama10/fibonacci-sequence).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the source code files are located.

4. Run the following command to compile the code:

   ```shell
   gcc fibonacci_sequence.c -o fibonacci_sequence
   ```

   This command uses the GCC compiler to compile the `fibonacci_sequence.c` file and generates an executable named `fibonacci_sequence`.

5. If the compilation is successful, an executable file (`fibonacci_sequence` or `fibonacci_sequence.exe`) will be generated in the same directory.

## How to Run

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the executable file is located.

2. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   ./fibonacci_sequence
   ```

   If you're on Windows, use `fibonacci_sequence.exe` instead.

3. The program will execute and display the results of the expression tree evaluation.

## Customization

You can customize the expression tree by modifying the code in the `main` function. Feel free to create your own mathematical expressions using the available operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, ABS, FIB) and test different scenarios.
